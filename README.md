# Event Scraper  

A web scraper built using  Puppeteer (library by Google Chrome) to scrape information of various events organised by various societies and clubs. Scraped information is consumed by a [mobile application](https://github.com/mannprerak2/event_hub_flutter) that displays the details of the various events.
